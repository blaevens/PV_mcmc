# PV MCMC package
This repository contains various scripts to obtain orientation, tilt and system size of photovoltaic systems using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. 
The idea is to follow the [Jupyter notebook](mcmc.ipynb).

## Requirements
Please consult the requirements.txt file, which contains all the various packages necessary to run the notebook. This project has been tested under Linux, using Python 3.7. Pyenv was used for Python version management and virtualenv was used to set up the virtual environment.
